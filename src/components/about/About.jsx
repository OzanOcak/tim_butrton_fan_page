        <p className="about-sub">
          Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California.
        </p>
        <p className="about-desc">
          As a preteen, Burton would make short films in his backyard at 2101
          North Evergreen Street using crude stop motion animation techniques or
          shooting on 8 mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile
          films is The Island of Doctor Agor, which he made when he was 13 years
          old). Burton attended Burbank High School but was not a particularly
          good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton
          was an introspective person and found pleasure in artwork, painting,
          drawing, and watching movies. His future work would be heavily
          influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as Dr. Seuss and
          Roald Dahl. After graduating from Burbank High School, Burton attended
          the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita, to
          study character animation. As a student at CalArts, Burton made the
          shorts Stalk of the Celery Monster and King and Octopus.
